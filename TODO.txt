--> tests !!!
--> if the user does not exist, we do not connect him, but maybe we should give the possibility to add the user if we receive his certificate and the user is not subscribed yet ? So, subscribe a user with eID ?  Retrieve data from card using a Java applet ?
--> how to add properties to a user ?  Still use portal_memberdata ?
--> save the https address in a property of the template, not hardcoded in template/i18n

HISTORY :
=========
0.1 Alpha2
--> Connection based on national register number :
	--> connection is available manually (username+passwd) and with eID card
	--> connect user with eID if subscribed (lookup national register number)
--> Depends on CPDescriptive product for memberdata extension and subscribing form

0.1 Alpha1
--> Connect with an existing user, without testing
